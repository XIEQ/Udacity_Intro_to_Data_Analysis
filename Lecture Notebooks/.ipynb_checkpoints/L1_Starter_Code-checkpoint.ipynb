    "- Remember that you can see from the left side of a code cell when it was last run if there is a number within the brackets.\n",
    "- When you start a new notebook session, make sure you run all of the cells up to the point where you last left off. Even if the output is still visible from when you ran the cells in your previous session, the kernel starts in a fresh state so you'll need to reload the data, etc. on a new session.\n",
    "- The previous point is useful to keep in mind if your answers do not match what is expected in the lesson's quizzes. Try reloading the data and run all of the processing steps one by one in order to make sure that you are working with the same variables and data that are at each quiz stage.\n",
